# My First Machine Learning Model
This notebook is part of my first study on Machine Learning from the ML Study Jam. 
  
ML Study Jam is a four-week Machine Learning Bootcamp offered by Google for students who want to develop their ML and AI skills.

The dataset used in this project was imported from Kaggle and saved as csv file. 
The dataset is disponible in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?select=melb_data.csv

The objective of this study was to explore the application of Machine Learning models in predicting real estate values based on features such as location, area, built-up area,
etc., using previously identified price patterns for machine learning. Two models were studied, Decision Tree and Random Forest, which are popular machine learning algorithms 
for solving regression problems. The ultimate goal was to select the model with the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error), which is a commonly used metric for evaluating the accuracy
of regression models. By the end of this study, 
it is expected to have a deeper understanding of the application of these models in predicting real estate values and how to choose the best model for the given problem.
